# Rijkswaterstaat North Sea monitoring programme

## Requirements

A Conda environment that can be used to run the analysis scripts is specified in `environment.yml`.  This will be updated with each new release.

## Versioning

Analysis is conducted periodically in batches, where each batch consists of the samples from a few months of observations.  The major version number refers to how many batches of analysis are included up to this point.  The minor version number refers to updated dataset releases where the values have changed.
